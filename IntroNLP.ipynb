    "\n",
    "<!--\n",
    "Text Analysis can help with the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Searches and information retrieval**: Help find relevant information in large databases such as a systematic literature review. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Clustering**: Text clustering is organizing text documents into groups that share properties such as theme, author, or type of document. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Dimensionality Reduction**: Techniques such as topic modeling can summarize a large corpus of text by representing documents as mixtures of topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Text Summarization**: Create category-sensitive text summaries of a large corpus of text. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Machine Translation**: Translate from one language to another. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Document Classification**: Predicting which class label belongs to a document (in this tutorial comments are documents). \n",
    "\n",
    "* **LDA**: LDA (latent Dirichlet allocation) is a type of probabilistic model commonly used for topic modelling. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stemming**: Stemming is a type of text normalization where words that have different forms but their essential meaning are normalized to the original dictionary form of a word. For example \"go,\" \"went,\" and \"goes\" all stem from the lemma \"go.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stop Words**: Stop words are words that have little semantic meaning like prepositions, articles and common nouns. They can often be ingnored. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **TFIDF**: TFIDF (Term frequency-inverse document frequency) is an example of feature enginnering where the most important words are extracted by taking account their frequency in documents and the entire corpus of documents as a whole.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Tokenize**: Tokenization is the process by which text is sepearated into meaningful terms or phrases. For instance, separating sentences using punctuation. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Topic Modeling**: Topic modeling is an unsupervised learning method where groups of co-occuring words are clustered into topics. Typically, the words in a a cluster should be related and make sense (e.g, boat, ship, captain). Individual documents will then fall into multiple topics. \n",
    "\n",
    "* **Word (type) vs word token**: In text analysis, *word (type)* refers to a unique set of characters. A *word token* is any occurance of a *word (type)*. For example, the sentence 'Oh boy, that boy is impressive!' contains 6 *word tokens*, but only 5 *word (types)*.   \n",

We quantify words as **one-hot encodings** and create document word counts by summing encodings over words in a documents. Scikit-learn as a [CountVectorizer method](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) that makes this step simple. \n",

For example, the words *the* or *for* may appear often throughout a corpus but contain very little semantic information. Conversely a document may contain obscure words that do not occur anywhere in else in the corpus which could cause models to overfit. These cases are managed by setting a threshold for the Min and Max Document Frequency(DF).  "

    "### Activity 2: Words are *Just Too Long*\n",
    "\n",
    "**20 mins**\n",
    "\n",
    "In text analysis, words are frequently **stemmed** or **lemmatized** in order to reduce the size of the vocubalary and treat words with similar semantic meaning as the same word. Stemming consists of removing parts of words to create a stem. For example, the word tokens `eat, eating, eatery, eaten, eater` would all be stemmed to the word `eat`. The CountVectorizer provides an easy way incorporate stemming into preprocessing via the *tokenizer* parameter which takes a function handle as an argument. For this activity, create a function to pass to the [CountVectorizer](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.feature_extraction.text.CountVectorizer.html) that will stem all words in your corpora. Use the CountVectorizer with this function as an argument to preprocess the corpus (this may take some time). Store the result in a variable called `stemmed_corpus`. Below is an example of a stemmer from the nltk toolkit that will be helpful.  "

For each test comment, the classifier produces a score indicating how confident the classifier is that the comment was posted in the depression subreddit. In order to produce classifications from these scores, we need to set a threshold above which a score is converted into a positive classificaiton. The ROC curve plots the false positive and true positive rate for every possible threshold we could set. We find the Area Under the Curve (AUC) which ranges from 0.5 (chance) to 1 (perfect prediction). The dashed line plots chance ROC."

That's pretty remarkable - it speaks to your empathy. You are not worthless. I think that you want to help people. You say that you don't even know why you try - but it sounds like you do know. You care about the world so much that it hurts. Helping people gives life meaning, right? And sometimes jerks may deny that or try to take that from you, but we all have to fight them. \n",

There is help out there though. Personally, I found support groups where people help me and I help them and they make my life not just survivable, but meaningful.

      "If life were just, heartbreak would kill you on the spot. It hurts so bad and so deep in places only that person could touch. And when the hurt is gone there is a big hole for a long time that can get filled up any number of ways. Some people fill it with anger - anger about a lot of things; their life, their ex, themselves. But anger only makes the hole bigger and deeper. Some people fill it with other things - sometimes good (family, friends, new relationships), sometimes not so good (one night stands, drugs, alcohol). But what really goes in that hole is you. You have to patch yourself back up with bits and pieces you find of yourself through some uncomfortable self-discovery. It takes a long time, and it hurts, but one day, without even realizing it's working, you'll look around and think, \"I feel whole again.\" And then your heart won't be broken and you'll have room inside for someone else. Someone who won't burn holes into your heart, but fill it up to the brim with strong, confident, love. \n",

I said \"fuck it\" to the life I thought I was going to lead (but couldn't because of the break up) and did something absolutely crazy. I sailed across the Indian Ocean. Trust me, nothing makes you dig deeper down into yourself and confront uncomfortable and varying truths like pitting yourself against a fierce ocean. Now obviously not everyone can do what I did. But I encourage you to take this time to dig deep into yourself and do something crazy that you never thought you could do. Travel, even if it's just outside your city. Learn about yourself, push your body, your mind, your soul hard. You'll find someone amazing worth loving inside. \n",

      "&gt; In short I want to die. That's it really. I just want to stop living. Not because I'm depressed from sadness, but because I'm tired. I'm only 19 years old and I feel like I'm 80. In high school teachers, counselors, etc. always use to ask my peers and I where we saw ourselves in ten years. I never knew the answer. I still don't. I can't picture my life in 10 years, or 5 years, or even next year. I hope I'm dead. Earlier I said I'm not depressed. That's not entirely true. Let me explain. I don't want to do anything with my life. The thought of going to college and having a career saddens me. Even the thought of having a simple job saddens me. The thought of interacting with strangers frightens me. The thought of living saddens me. I'm scum. I have the possibility to do anything with my life, and I don't have a hard life. My parent's didn't hit me. They didn't divorce. I have wonderful brothers and sisters, and yet I still feel this way. If I had the opportunity to not exist and somehow give my position to somebody who has had a hard life and suffered to them I would because at least they'd do something with it. I'd do it in a heartbeat. This is what depresses me. I am the definition of scum. I shouldn't be depressed, but I am. I don't feel like I deserve to be depressed but I am. And I hate myself even more because I am. I hold a small grudge towards my parents for bringing me into this world. I often find myself at night wishing they never met. Wishing I was never born. The thought of me not existing brings me such joy. But sadly I exist so the next best thing is death. And I would of killed myself by now but the thought of pain stops me. I'm too scared. Death is the only thing I want in life and once again the only person stopping me is me. I'm my own worst enemy. Sometimes I wonder if that's why I wanna kill myself. If somehow by committing suicide, I have killed the person who's made me feel the way I feel. I haven't told anyone the way I feel. No friends or family. I often joke to my friends about suicide but I'm positive they think I'm joking and have no idea how badly I want to die. This one time my friend casually told me at a party that he was kind of depressed, and he was describing exactly how I felt, and what did I do? I basically told him to shut up because no one wanted to hear that. I don't know why I told him that. I wonder if it was because he described my feelings and I felt like I couldn't accept it at the time. I regret it everyday of my life. It's another reason why I hate myself. My friend didn't commit suicide, and we've hung out since then, but he's never talked about it again and I haven't asked him. I'm not even good enough to be his friend. I've never felt connected to my family. At least not enough to ever tell them my feelings. I feel like my brothers and sisters were made for each other, if that makes sense. Like when you learn that they're related you think \"yeah, that makes sense\" but me, not so much. I'm nothing like them. We don't like the same things, and our personalities are so different that when we get together, like at a family gathering, I find that I don't talk to them much. and when we do they generally ask how's it going and I just say \"fine\". I've felt so lonely my entire life. Ever since I was a child. I've never had a girlfriend and at this point I don't even want one because I'm worried if I start dating someone and I tell her how I feel that she'll feel like she now has to stay in the relationship so I don't commit suicide. I often day dream of hanging out with this chick I had a crush on in one of my high school classes. We both love reggae music and we'd listen to it in class every now and then. I kind of gave signals that I was interested, but she never did anything. When I was attending community college she had the professor I had before me, and we'd talk for a few minutes. The first couple times was just catching up cause we didn't see each other for a while, and after that it was just me asking what we did in class. Now that I've dropped out of college I still think about her. I've even had dreams about her where we were just hanging out. I don't think that's healthy. I think I love her, but at the same time I just think I feel this way because I feel shitty. But when I dream of her I don't hurt so bad. But I'm just her friend, and I think I'm ok with that but it still hurts because she'll never know how I feel, but at the same time I know she doesn't feel the same. At this point I feel like I'm carrying a heavy weight and it just gets heavier and heavier. But I keep carrying it, and I want to drop it. But somehow I put a smile on my face, not because I'm happy but because the thought of losing this weight makes me laugh and the thought of me killing myself makes me laugh, because I know I'll carry it forever and I know I won't ever have the balls to kill myself, so I feel I'll always feel this way, but who knows. To me death sounds good all the time so maybe when I'm at my breaking point I'll do it. I have a lot more to say, but at this point I can't really think of a reason to keep going.\n",

      "Job and money is... tricky. Our culture has esteemed the kind of job we have and the amount of money in our accounts to be the measures of success, and this puts a ton of pressure to adhere to that standard to find self-worth in this cruel life where not everyone starts on the same level. It's scary, because I don't have everything figured out, still trying to search for my career, and I have just enough to meek out a living with just enough to save and spend a little to have some fun. And guess what? I'm 27. I have a bachelor's which amounted to no career, and I'm trying to get back into school for a different bachelor's with a much better job pool; you're 21, and not to come off patronizing but there is plenty of time for you to keep searching and find your calling. If money is an issue regarding school, there is FAFSA you can apply for (assuming you're in the U.S.); you can start building a solid credit score if you haven't already by opening a credit line and treating it as you would a debit card to spend what you can afford while paying off the debt in full; you can work on getting certified or start community college to knock out general ed for much cheaper than you would at a uni if you haven't started school yet; you can bite the bullet and work part time somewhere to start your collection of job experience, or even consult a temp agency to get your foot in somewhere.

Try Meetup.com. You can search based on your interests and hobbies, and if you don't have much hobbies to speak of try picking up something simple and small. It's daunting to meet new people, believe me I know. It took me years to develop extroverted habits, and even then I'm still an introvert at heart and need to recluse from social things to recharge my batteries. It's disheartening to put yourself out there and deal with rejection, but when it comes to social aspects in life it's what it takes, and the more you expose yourself to it the less daunting it will seem because you give yourself the opportunities to learn from what did and didn't work, and this most definitely applies to the dating world... which leads to:\n",

It's a very helpful subreddit, and I refined my workout routines as a result of consulting there often. The thing with fitness is, it's difficult. It's really tough to get started, and it's a whole new battle to maintain it. **However**, once you start, it only gets better from there. It's so easy to sit down and look back to think \"If I only started __ years ago, I'd be so much more fit now...\", but with fitness your best time to start is NOW. It doesn't even have to start at the gym if money is an issue, because weight loss comes from the kitchen. If you're drinking 10 cans of soda a week, cut it down to 8 a week; then 6; then 4; then 2; then ween yourself from it and replace it with the occasional 100% juice. If you're eating fast food 3 meals a day, cut it down to 2, then 1, all the while making a trip or two to the market and avoid the aisles; slowly replace a meal or snack with something you can simply whip up in the kitchen. Even just grilling chicken and stir frying your veggies is a big step up from ordering your usual from the take out joint.\n",

Should you start going to the gym, don't make the wild expectation that you're going to go every day every morning if it's not your routine yet; start small. Try every two days, every other day, and once you get the hang of it you should add more gym days. I'm currently 205lbs at 6'3\", maybe at about 16-17% body fat. Not bad, but considering I used to be 250+lbs and struggled with eating right and maintaining good exercising and eating habits over the past 10+ years until now, it's a milestone for me.

    "# Comment Similarity and Clustering: Unsupervised Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The first step in grouping documents is to define a measure of similarity between documents. A common measure of similarity for non-text data is euclidean distance. However the euclidean distance between document-term vectors ignore the length of the document. For example, if document one consists of a single sentence and document two consists of that same sentence repeated multiple times, the euclidean distance will be nonzero. To overcome this issue documents are often compared using cosine similarity, which measures the angle between two count vectors. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Cosine Similarity \n",
    "\n",
    "The cosine similarity between two vectors ${\\bf x}$ and ${\\bf y}$ is defined as: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\textrm{cos}({\\bf x},{\\bf y}) = \\frac{{\\bf x} \\bullet {\\bf y}}{||\\bf x|| \\; || \\bf y ||}$$. \n",
    "\n",
    "The common conceptual interpretations of the cosine similarity is the angle between two vectors. In text analysis each document is represented as a point in a $V$-dimensional, where $V$ is the size of the vocabulary. Thus by normalizing we are looking at the percent of a document that each word compromises instead of the raw counts of word tokens. \n",

I'm strong but was still developing mentally at 18, still learning the world and who I was. Uncontrollable actions, such as fits of depression and anger made my life hell. The others picked up on it. I felt like they would rather leave me behind then help my up. I was right. I have one very vivid memory that I remember every day. I was laying in my bed (separated from the other beds in the middle of the room), with my two \"guards\" standing watch. Yeah, I had to have at least two people within arms reach of me at all times, even while sleeping. It got that bad. One of them decided he didn't have time for this. All I did was look at him and sigh. He took my pillow from under my head and tried to suffocate me. And I just laid there. Not moving. I didn't care. It didn't last long as the other people in the room (47 people) stepped in. After the event the drill sergeant walked in, unaware of the events that had transpired moments before. He walked up to me as I was laying in bed again. He bent over me and asked my how I was. I said that I was fine and he left. It has taken me a very long time to understand how I felt about this. Turns out I was angry at myself for failing something that I set out to do. I felt like garbage for so long. It took me 5 years to admit to myself that my self directed anger and loathing ment nothing. The past is the past. There is nothing that can be done about it. But my future, my happiness needs not be influenced by past failures. I was angry at myself, and I finally learned why. And I finally forgave myself.\n",
