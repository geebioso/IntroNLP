      " Yes, that's true. You've got to know that psychiatrists still focus on the medical aspect of mental illnesses and not on psychotherapy. Usually with psychiatrists, it's better to just give enough context to describe your depression, like what significant feelings upset you or other big concerns. This is just so you can elaborate everything with your therapist, because that's what therapists focus on. And if you do spill out stuff with your psychiatrist most of the time, then you'll lose the need to share the same things with your therapist since it's already out of your system. Just my two cents.\n",
      "\n",
      "Also, does your psychiatrist and therapist know each other? While your secrets or the events you've shared to your therapist (or psych) are completely confidential - they're not allowed to exchange those matters, ethically speaking) - usually the psychiatrist can call your therapist to update on your medications on any physical concerns (e.g. self-harm, headaches, med side-effects related to depression).\n",

Our culture has esteemed the kind of job we have and the amount of money in our accounts to be the measures of success, and this puts a ton of pressure to adhere to that standard to find self-worth in this cruel life where not everyone starts on the same level. It's scary, because I don't have everything figured out, still trying to search for my career, and I have just enough to meek out a living with just enough to save and spend a little to have some fun. And guess what? I'm 27. I have a bachelor's which amounted to no career, and I'm trying to get back into school for a different bachelor's with a much better job pool; you're 21, and not to come off patronizing but there is plenty of time for you to keep searching and find your calling. If money is an issue regarding school, there is FAFSA you can apply for (assuming you're in the U.S.); you can start building a solid credit score if you haven't already by opening a credit line and treating it as you would a debit card to spend what you can afford while paying off the debt in full; you can work on getting certified or start community college to knock out general ed for much cheaper than you would at a uni if you haven't started school yet; you can bite the bullet and work part time somewhere to start your collection of job experience, or even consult a temp agency to get your foot in somewhere.

Try Meetup.com. You can search based on your interests and hobbies, and if you don't have much hobbies to speak of try picking up something simple and small. It's daunting to meet new people, believe me I know. It took me years to develop extroverted habits, and even then I'm still an introvert at heart and need to recluse from social things to recharge my batteries. It's disheartening to put yourself out there and deal with rejection, but when it comes to social aspects in life it's what it takes, and the more you expose yourself to it the less daunting it will seem because you give yourself the opportunities to learn from what did and didn't work, and this most definitely applies to the dating world... which leads to:\n",

It's a very helpful subreddit, and I refined my workout routines as a result of consulting there often. The thing with fitness is, it's difficult. It's really tough to get started, and it's a whole new battle to maintain it. **However**, once you start, it only gets better from there. It's so easy to sit down and look back to think \"If I only started __ years ago, I'd be so much more fit now...\", but with fitness your best time to start is NOW. It doesn't even have to start at the gym if money is an issue, because weight loss comes from the kitchen. If you're drinking 10 cans of soda a week, cut it down to 8 a week; then 6; then 4; then 2; then ween yourself from it and replace it with the occasional 100% juice. If you're eating fast food 3 meals a day, cut it down to 2, then 1, all the while making a trip or two to the market and avoid the aisles; slowly replace a meal or snack with something you can simply whip up in the kitchen. Even just grilling chicken and stir frying your veggies is a big step up from ordering your usual from the take out joint.\n",

Should you start going to the gym, don't make the wild expectation that you're going to go every day every morning if it's not your routine yet; start small. Try every two days, every other day, and once you get the hang of it you should add more gym days. I'm currently 205lbs at 6'3\", maybe at about 16-17% body fat. Not bad, but considering I used to be 250+lbs and struggled with eating right and maintaining good exercising and eating habits over the past 10+ years until now, it's a milestone for me.

When you find the things you know you can work on, whether it's eating habits or even something more abstract like having a hard time engaging people in conversation, it's a lot easier to break down the issues into smaller, realistic quest lines to complete.

I started on medication and decided to stick with it because I wanted to pass my semester. I had previously dropped out of school and I really wanted to finish my degree. I experience a lot of classroom anxiety so I would avoid going to class. On the sertraline, boom, anxiety in the classroom gone. It took me about 3 months to get to that point - so give your medication time to work.\n",

I also recall reading about something called \"the rule of thirds\": this refers to how in clinical studies for a particular antidepressant, the pattern tends to be that 1/3 of patients will go into partial remission (i.e., they are almost completely better but have residual symptoms), 1/3 will go into full remission, and 1/3 will not show any response.\n",

And when the hurt is gone there is a big hole for a long time that can get filled up any number of ways. Some people fill it with anger - anger about a lot of things; their life, their ex, themselves. But anger only makes the hole bigger and deeper. Some people fill it with other things - sometimes good (family, friends, new relationships), sometimes not so good (one night stands, drugs, alcohol). But what really goes in that hole is you. You have to patch yourself back up with bits and pieces you find of yourself through some uncomfortable self-discovery. It takes a long time, and it hurts, but one day, without even realizing it's working, you'll look around and think, \"I feel whole again.\" And then your heart won't be broken and you'll have room inside for someone else.

      "&gt; In short I want to die. That's it really. I just want to stop living. Not because I'm depressed from sadness, but because I'm tired. I'm only 19 years old and I feel like I'm 80. In high school teachers, counselors, etc. always use to ask my peers and I where we saw ourselves in ten years. I never knew the answer. I still don't. I can't picture my life in 10 years, or 5 years, or even next year. I hope I'm dead. Earlier I said I'm not depressed. That's not entirely true. Let me explain. I don't want to do anything with my life. The thought of going to college and having a career saddens me. Even the thought of having a simple job saddens me. The thought of interacting with strangers frightens me. The thought of living saddens me. I'm scum. I have the possibility to do anything with my life, and I don't have a hard life. My parent's didn't hit me. They didn't divorce. I have wonderful brothers and sisters, and yet I still feel this way. If I had the opportunity to not exist and somehow give my position to somebody who has had a hard life and suffered to them I would because at least they'd do something with it. I'd do it in a heartbeat. This is what depresses me. I am the definition of scum. I shouldn't be depressed, but I am. I don't feel like I deserve to be depressed but I am. And I hate myself even more because I am. I hold a small grudge towards my parents for bringing me into this world. I often find myself at night wishing they never met. Wishing I was never born. The thought of me not existing brings me such joy. But sadly I exist so the next best thing is death. And I would of killed myself by now but the thought of pain stops me. I'm too scared. Death is the only thing I want in life and once again the only person stopping me is me. I'm my own worst enemy. Sometimes I wonder if that's why I wanna kill myself. If somehow by committing suicide, I have killed the person who's made me feel the way I feel. I haven't told anyone the way I feel. No friends or family. I often joke to my friends about suicide but I'm positive they think I'm joking and have no idea how badly I want to die. This one time my friend casually told me at a party that he was kind of depressed, and he was describing exactly how I felt, and what did I do? I basically told him to shut up because no one wanted to hear that. I don't know why I told him that. I wonder if it was because he described my feelings and I felt like I couldn't accept it at the time. I regret it everyday of my life. It's another reason why I hate myself. My friend didn't commit suicide, and we've hung out since then, but he's never talked about it again and I haven't asked him. I'm not even good enough to be his friend. I've never felt connected to my family. At least not enough to ever tell them my feelings. I feel like my brothers and sisters were made for each other, if that makes sense. Like when you learn that they're related you think \"yeah, that makes sense\" but me, not so much. I'm nothing like them. We don't like the same things, and our personalities are so different that when we get together, like at a family gathering, I find that I don't talk to them much. and when we do they generally ask how's it going and I just say \"fine\". I've felt so lonely my entire life. Ever since I was a child. I've never had a girlfriend and at this point I don't even want one because I'm worried if I start dating someone and I tell her how I feel that she'll feel like she now has to stay in the relationship so I don't commit suicide. I often day dream of hanging out with this chick I had a crush on in one of my high school classes. We both love reggae music and we'd listen to it in class every now and then. I kind of gave signals that I was interested, but she never did anything. When I was attending community college she had the professor I had before me, and we'd talk for a few minutes. The first couple times was just catching up cause we didn't see each other for a while, and after that it was just me asking what we did in class. Now that I've dropped out of college I still think about her. I've even had dreams about her where we were just hanging out. I don't think that's healthy. I think I love her, but at the same time I just think I feel this way because I feel shitty. But when I dream of her I don't hurt so bad. But I'm just her friend, and I think I'm ok with that but it still hurts because she'll never know how I feel, but at the same time I know she doesn't feel the same. At this point I feel like I'm carrying a heavy weight and it just gets heavier and heavier. But I keep carrying it, and I want to drop it. But somehow I put a smile on my face, not because I'm happy but because the thought of losing this weight makes me laugh and the thought of me killing myself makes me laugh, because I know I'll carry it forever and I know I won't ever have the balls to kill myself, so I feel I'll always feel this way, but who knows. To me death sounds good all the time so maybe when I'm at my breaking point I'll do it. I have a lot more to say, but at this point I can't really think of a reason to keep going.\n",

I prayed to god that I would get into a traffic accident on the way to school, and I would be the only fatality. I sat in first period fantasizing every single day about slitting my wrists and hiding my arms in a backpack until I bled out and my corpse would rest quietly on my desk. I walked on the way to fourth period fantasizing about jumping off a second story building and landing ever so perfectly on my neck to instantly kill myself.

      " My name is Andrew. I live in tucson AZ and I'm 30 years old. I have had depression all my life. It hit me the hardest when I was a teenager after I found out about my biological father and how he abandoned me and my mother when I was a baby. That news in the beginning started off as a curiosity and then became a never ending insecurity about myself. I started feeling not good enough, and to top it all off my adoptive father who married my mother when I was a baby was military, so I lived in a very strict household where it was hard for me to get proper support in all that I did. \n",

      "When I was 20 I hit low point and due to flunking out of basic training and being pawned off to different family members outside of my own family and because I felt so worthless that nobody wanted me around and dealing with my parents divorce, I then tried to kill myself via overdose. I got scared, and ended up in the hospital for a week and even then the docs didn't care enough to really help other then ask a few questions and to get the drugs out of my system. They sent me on my not so merry way without any true help so I learned to bury my emotions and hid myself from most people for years. Afterwards never quite making it job wise and moving around alot even getting into trouble for stealing jewelry from my mom and pawning it. She had me arrested. I got hit with the book. 2 years probation, community service and MORE, that plus I was homeless during this time. \n",
      "\n",
      "Fast forward to these last 4 years and I was finally in a good place job wise, met the love of my life and we proceeded to date for 4 years in a LDR. She was old fashioned, wanted to be taken care of, one of those red pill women types, I was fine with it and wanted things to work. In the beginning I worked hard to give us a future, spent money flying her down to visit 3 to 4 times during the year for 2 weeks at a time, we were both gamers so when we were apart we would play WoW and other games online and spent time with each other every single day to the point of unhealthy clinging for both of us. To the point where she would get upset if I wanted to hang out with a friend or give myself some me time. That went on enough that I pushed alot of people away because if I didn't spend time with her I would feel bad or somewhat scared she would get upset enough and want to break up. I eventually started school full time so I was working and going to school full time, pretty busy with that and her but for the most part I was happier then I ever have been. The LDR took it's toll a bit and because of the clinging I broke up with her last June for a day, it broke her when I did that, I regret it alot because it started the chain of events that happened afterwards. I begged her back because I loved her and I wanted to work on things, she normally had a rule that she wouldn't do off and on relationships but she loved me and she wanted to try again. Things started out okay, i turned 30 last October she came to visit for most of the month and it was great when we were together in person we were perfect we had no problems ever. When she went back home we tried to figure out a way to move in together but her personality was an extreme in which she didn't work or go to school ever and wanted so badly to be a housewife and stay at home mom that trying to convince her to work to help me a bit so we can earn our way to that point was like pulling teeth. There were times she would give in a bit and semi agree to things but it was just to placate me she never really wanted those things. She also really loved animals, she had a dog and several cats and she wanted at least her dog jack and her cat Cooper with her which I couldn't afford. She tried to make it so I moved in with her at her mom's house instead, but I had a good job and going to school it was illogical to drop everything like that. In the end we held off on moving in together because it would be all me taking care of her and I was too poor. Thus last January we talked about things and I asked her if she was unhappy, she was a little bit but enough that I said she had to make a choice since I didn't want to end things and keep trying. So we broke up, and in the end it was the LDR that killed it. \n",
      "\n",
      "I started off okay, trying to move on and move forward I was pretty upset and my heart was broken, I loved this women she was soul mate and the love of my life in every way, she had her flaws but we all did. We tried to stay friends because we had been through too much not to, we were a relationship of firsts for both of us so our connection was very very strong. Fast forward to February, I had noticed some distance, she was seeing someone already, it was a shock, it hit me in my heart, I was already broken up but she had already moved on? He even told her he loved her already she said, they barely knew each other, all my past came boiling to the front, the abandonment, the self hatred, what had I done? I wasn't ready for this and I still loved her,  I broke down mentally, lost my job, quit school. I spent the next month pleading with her to take me back that I still loved her that it was a mistake that we ended things but it was too late. She told me that moment last June during our first break up killed her and even though she tried she held onto it, she kept the texts, she kept them. She said it wasn't fair to this new guy, we were together almost 4 years we were supposed to get married and have kids this isn't supposed to be this way. We stopped talking for a bit but I kept trying to reach out to her, threatening suicide. I had to see a therapist and take medication for everything that was done. Now it's April her bday was that month he was taking her to Hawaii, he was well off money wise, could give her all she wanted, she sends me a picture when she is there, he asked her to marry him and now she is engaged. That picture was the final straw, it broke me. In the end she proved that she probably never really loved me as much as she said she did. During the whole of the relationship I carried it on my shoulders and gave her all that I could give. Lost a few things that I won't get back. Now she has what she wants, and I was stuck picking up the pieces dealing with my depression again, I didn't have a job and I didn't have school anymore I didn't care about alot of things. \n",

I can't talk to her anymore, she felt bad and guilty for the way things went but because it wasn't fair to her new fiance I couldn't talk to her anymore, she even said that he recommended a restraining order if it got bad enough. Sigh how can you go from what we had to that so quickly? I am bombarded by memories of my past and now her every day and it is a struggle but I push, even trying to get back to my military weight again.
